A Palestinian boy, 13-year-old Ali Abu Alia, was shot and killed by Israeli military forces during clashes with stone-throwing Palestinians in the West Bank. In Lebanon, mourners held vigil marking four months since their relatives were killed during the Aug. 4 Beirut port explosion that killed more than 200 people and injured thousands. In Jerusalem, ultra-orthodox Jewish men laid to rest Rabbi Aharon David Hadash, the spiritual leader of the Mir Yeshiva, who had tested positive for the coronavirus.
