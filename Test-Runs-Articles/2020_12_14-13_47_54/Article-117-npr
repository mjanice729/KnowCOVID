David Smith (left) and Kenneth Felts in Denver in 2013, the year their friendship began. Felts told Smith that before he came out as gay this year, "I was secretly really envying you, to be able to be yourself."It wasn't until this year that 90-year-old Kenneth Felts told his family that he is gay — a secret he'd kept for more than 60 years.In July, he spoke with his daughter, Rebecca Mayes, about his first love. Having so much alone time during the coronavirus pandemic, he told her, "drug up all these memories from the past."Felts recorded another remote StoryCorps interview recently to talk to the person who inspired him the most along his coming-out journey — his friend David Smith.Felts told Smith, who is openly gay, that before he came out this year, "I was secretly really envying you, to be able to be yourself."The two first met in 2013 at a local recreation center in Westminster, Colo., when Smith was a substitute teacher for Felts' water aerobics class. Soon after, Felts asked Smith to be his personal trainer.Back then, Felts wanted to talk to Smith about the possibility that he might be attracted to men, he said, but he just wasn't ready yet."Most of my gay I had buried very deep. And it wasn't available at that time, even to me," he said.

"Everybody fights their own battles, and everybody has their own mountains to climb. And I think that's the biggest lesson that you taught me."Since 2018, Smith has been living in Cologne, Germany, where he's pursuing a master's degree in sports science. He corresponds with Felts regularly by email; he has been helping read over parts of a memoir Felts is working on."I get emotional when I think of our friendship," said Felts. "But it was very meaningful to me and still is and will always be."Felts' decision to come out has also paid off in his dating life.After seeing one of his interviews about coming out at 90, Felts' now-boyfriend, John, reached out to him on Facebook. They shared a first date in October and have been together ever since.Audio produced for Morning Edition by Sylvie Lubow.
