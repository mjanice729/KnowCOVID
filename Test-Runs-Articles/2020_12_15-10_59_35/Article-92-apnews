RICHMND, Va. (AP) â€” The cost of wood in the home construction market has increased this year because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported Friday that industry observers say that prices of some kinds of lumber have more than doubled during parts of this year.For instance, the cost per thousand board feet was less than $400 in January. But it was more than $900 in September. David Logan is the director of tax and trade policy analysis for the National Association of Home Builders. He said that mills started curtailing operations as the pandemic spread throughout the country and lockdown orders were issued. But he said there was also a surge in do-it-yourself activity. Demand rose from big-box stores for at-home projects and small contracted projects. The housing market also bounced back faster than most expected. The group said rising lumber costs have added about $16,000 to the average price of a single-family home.
