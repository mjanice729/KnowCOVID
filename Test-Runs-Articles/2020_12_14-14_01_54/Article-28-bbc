"Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately. If we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependent on how Tesla is treated in the future."Frankly, this is the final straw.

It "has been winning for a long time, and I think they're taking [firms] for granted a little bit," he added.Texas might also offer some tax benefits for the world's second-richest man.It does not collect personal income tax, while California has some of the highest state tax rates in the United States.Last month, Mr Musk's net worth jumped by $7.2bn to $128bn after shares in Tesla surged.Only Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is richer, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Coronavirus: Elon Musk vows to move Tesla factory in lockdown rowTech Tent: Is Tesla really worth $500 billion?Elon Musk becomes world's second richest personTesla shrugs off pandemic as sales hit new recordplaySpaceX launch: What is SpaceX and why is it going to the ISS?âHealing is comingâ says US nurse getting vaccineThe first dose was given in New York, kicking off the largest vaccination drive in US history.'New variant' of coronavirus identified in Englandplay'Taken from our parents... our identities erased' Video'Taken from our parents... our identities erased'Bogus reports, accidental finds - the Oxford vaccine storyContact tracer: 'People threaten us and block our calls'How fact met fiction in Le CarrÃ©'s secret worldTentative progress made as EU hints at concessionsBrexit trade talks leave firms 'utterly confusedâSeeing my family at Christmas 'not worth the risk'The 'unsanitised' stories behind pioneering feministsThe surprise Christmas show for an audience of oneHow clean is the air in your office?From the covers of Vogue to setting up MalaikaNoella Coursaris Musunka shares her inspirational storyDaily news briefing direct to your inboxSign up for our newsletter'New variant' of coronavirus identified in England1Pornhub removes all user-uploaded videos amid legality row2Electoral college begins casting votes that will cement Biden victory3Jesy Nelson leaves Little Mix: 'The constant pressure is very hard'4Covid-19: Trump rejects plan for early vaccines at White House5Google outage: YouTube, Docs and Gmail knocked offline6Covid-19: First vaccine given in US as roll-out begins7Alexei Navalny: Report names 'Russian agents' in poisoning case8New York cathedral gunman shot dead by police9Australia storms: Byron Bay's Main Beach 'all but disappeared'10Â© 2020 BBC.
