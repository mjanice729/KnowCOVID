The first doses of a Covid-19 vaccine are due to be rolled out in Jersey next week.Chief minister John Le Fondre said care home residents would be the first to get the Pfizer/BioNTech jab from 14 December. Coronavirus cases in the island rose to 536 on Monday, with 31 new infections identified and 11 recoveries.Senator Le Fondre warned visits to care homes would be "paused", with the exception of end-of-life patients.He said that would continue until it was "safe to resume".   On Monday the chief minister announced care home staff would also be vaccinated from 21 December.He said any remaining stock would be reserved for "front-line health staff", but did not offer a timeframe for other islanders.The second dose of the vaccine would be delivered to care home residents and staff in January, he added.Mr Le Fondre said it meant many of the island's most high-risk residents would "have immunity from Covid-19 by the end of January 2021". He said the government had taken the "incredibly difficult decision" to ask all care home residents to shield from Tuesday because "we cannot vaccinate people who are sick".There are currently 23 Covid-19 patients in hospital, an increase of six since Sunday's results were released.Addressing the latest surge in cases, the island's deputy medical officer of health Dr Ivan Muscat said he believed 50% of "all infections" in Jersey were detected by its testing regime.The government has introduced tighter coronavirus restrictions in recent weeks, including the mandatory wearing of masks in shops and a hospitality circuit-breaker.Covid: Jersey records highest daily figureJersey delays in Covid-19 testing and contact tracingCovid-19: Jersey vaccination centre at Fort RegentEarly hours âhit and runâ damages three carsIslanders give their bosses 6.2 out of ten News | Less than an hour agoWoman taken to hospital after tree falls on car in St John News | Less than an hour agoCrucial Parker meeting minutes âincompleteâCovid-19 vaccine arrives in Jersey ahead of rolloutInformation about BBC links to other news sitesâHealing is comingâ says US nurse getting vaccineThe first dose was given in New York, kicking off the largest vaccination drive in US history.'New variant' of coronavirus identified in Englandplay'Taken from our parents... our identities erased' Video'Taken from our parents... our identities erased'Bogus reports, accidental finds - the Oxford vaccine storyContact tracer: 'People threaten us and block our calls'How fact met fiction in Le CarrÃ©'s secret worldTentative progress made as EU hints at concessionsBrexit trade talks leave firms 'utterly confusedâSeeing my family at Christmas 'not worth the risk'The 'unsanitised' stories behind pioneering feministsThe surprise Christmas show for an audience of oneHow clean is the air in your office?From the covers of Vogue to setting up MalaikaNoella Coursaris Musunka shares her inspirational storyDaily news briefing direct to your inboxSign up for our newsletter'New variant' of coronavirus identified in England1Pornhub removes all user-uploaded videos amid legality row2Electoral college begins casting votes that will cement Biden victory3Jesy Nelson leaves Little Mix: 'The constant pressure is very hard'4Covid-19: Trump rejects plan for early vaccines at White House5Google outage: YouTube, Docs and Gmail knocked offline6Covid-19: First vaccine given in US as roll-out begins7Alexei Navalny: Report names 'Russian agents' in poisoning case8New York cathedral gunman shot dead by police9Australia storms: Byron Bay's Main Beach 'all but disappeared'10Â© 2020 BBC.
