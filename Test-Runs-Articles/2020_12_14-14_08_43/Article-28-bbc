The Russian government has confirmed spreadsheets containing private details of Covid-19 patients from Moscow have been published online.An official has said an internal inquiry found a mistake had been made rather than hackers being to blame.Readovka, the news site that revealed the leak, says the files indicate official statistics may have under-reported the true number of cases.It says 300,000 names are listed alongside diagnoses and test results.Medical insurance numbers, home addresses, telephone numbers and passport details were also featured alongside other personal information.Current Time - a news network led by Radio Liberty in co-operation with Voice of America - has also carried out checks of its own on the data to confirm the details matched those of real people.According to Russian news agency Tass, 660,073 cases of the coronavirus have officially been detected in Moscow.But the files contain only a subset of these."During the checks, we have established that there has been no violation of the information system of the Moscow city government," Moscow Department of Information Technologies head Eduard Lysenko said."The leak occurred due to human error - members of staff who were processing these documents had allowed for the files to be passed on to third persons.""Measures" would follow, he added, which some local reports have taken to mean there could be criminal prosecutions.Tass reported 362 Excel files involving a total of 940MB of data had been uploaded, some running to more than 100,000 lines.The affair comes a week after it was revealed the personal data of everyone who had ever registered with Brazil's publicly-funded healthcare system had been put at risk by a password being accidentally left in the code of the government's Covid-19 notification system.More than 200 million living and dead people's names, addresses and other details could have been decrypted and accessed as a consequence.Brazil's government has said the issue has been fixed.Coronavirus: Sputnik V vaccine rushed out to wary RussiansExcel: Why using Microsoft's tool caused Covid-19 results to be lostâHealing is comingâ says US nurse getting vaccineThe first dose was given in New York, kicking off the largest vaccination drive in US history.'New variant' of coronavirus identified in Englandplay'Taken from our parents... our identities erased' Video'Taken from our parents... our identities erased'Bogus reports, accidental finds - the Oxford vaccine storyContact tracer: 'People threaten us and block our calls'How fact met fiction in Le CarrÃ©'s secret worldTentative progress made as EU hints at concessionsBrexit trade talks leave firms 'utterly confusedâSeeing my family at Christmas 'not worth the risk'The 'unsanitised' stories behind pioneering feministsThe surprise Christmas show for an audience of oneHow clean is the air in your office?From the covers of Vogue to setting up MalaikaNoella Coursaris Musunka shares her inspirational storyDaily news briefing direct to your inboxSign up for our newsletter'New variant' of coronavirus identified in England1Pornhub removes all user-uploaded videos amid legality row2Electoral college begins casting votes that will cement Biden victory3Jesy Nelson leaves Little Mix: 'The constant pressure is very hard'4Covid-19: Trump rejects plan for early vaccines at White House5Google outage: YouTube, Docs and Gmail knocked offline6Covid-19: First vaccine given in US as roll-out begins7Alexei Navalny: Report names 'Russian agents' in poisoning case8New York cathedral gunman shot dead by police9Australia storms: Byron Bay's Main Beach 'all but disappeared'10Â© 2020 BBC.
