Content:     AS WE ALL GRAPPLE WITH our new reality, it's difficult to think of anything beyond the basics. 
How do we keep our families safe? Are we washing our hands enough? 
Do we really have to sanitize the doorknobs and surfaces every day? 
How do we get our cats to stop videobombing our Zoom meetings? 
Do we have enough toilet paper?

The more we read the headlines, the more we feel the need to do something, or at least say something. 
Change is happening – ready or not. 
Maybe talking about some of these important issues can lead to action that will help us steer out of this skid.

Historically, Americans have found ways to meet their circumstances with intention, 
moving in mass to make heretofore unimaginable change that has sustained and improved our lives to this day. 
The Great Depression lead to the creation of the New Deal and Social Security. 
The Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire brought about change in labor conditions. 
The Cuyahoga River fire lead to the founding of the Environmental Protection Agency.

Could the COVID-19 pandemic be the turning point for universal health care? 
We can't think of a more propitious time. In the first two weeks of April, 5.2 million Americans filed for unemployment. 
Economists believe that 30% unemployment is possible by fall. For most Americans, our health care is tied to our employment, 
and because of this, millions of Americans are losing their health care just when they may need it the most. 
Economists predict that health insurance premiums will likely increase by 40% in the next year due to less payers and more who are in need of care and the eventual collapse of private health care insurance.

Our current circumstances have illustrated the need for universal health care in a way that is obvious and undeniable. 
Below we have listed the most frequent arguments in opposition followed by an evidence-based rebuttal.

1. Point: "Governments are wasteful and shouldn't be in charge of health care."

Counterpoint: 
In 2017, the U.S. spent twice as much on health care (17.1% of GDP) as comparable Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development countries (OECD) 
(8.8% of GDP), all of whom have universal health care. The country with the second highest expenditure after the U.S. is Switzerland at 12.3%, 
nearly 5% less. Of all these countries, the U.S. has the highest portion of private insurance. 
In terms of dollars spent, the average per capita health care spending of OECD countries is $3,558, while in the U.S. it's $10,207 – 
nearly three times as costly.

Bottom line: 
Among industrialized countries with comparable levels of economic development, government-provided health care is much more efficient and 
more economical than the U.S. system of private insurance.

2. Point: "U.S. health care is superior to the care offered by countries with universal health care."

Counterpoint: According to the Commonwealth Health Fund, in the U.S., 
infant mortality is higher and the life span is shorter than among all comparable economies that provide universal health care. 
Maternal mortality in the U.S. is 30 per 100,000 births and 6.4 per 100,000 births on average in comparable countries, which is nearly five times worse.

In addition, the U.S. has the highest chronic disease burden (e.g., diabetes, hypertension) and an obesity rate that is two times higher 
than the OECD average. In part due to these neglected conditions, in comparison to comparable countries, 
the U.S. (as of 2016) had among the highest number of hospitalizations from preventable causes and the highest rate of avoidable deaths.

The Peterson-Kaiser Health System Tracker, which is a collaborative effort to monitor the quality and cost of U.S. health care, 
shows that among comparable countries with universal health care, mortality rate is lower across the board on everything from heart attacks to child birth. 
The U.S. also has higher rates of medical, medication and lab errors relative to similar countries with universal health care.

Bottom line: With our largely privately funded health care system, we are paying more than twice as much as other countries for worse outcomes.

3. Point: "Universal health care would be more expensive."

Counterpoint: 
The main reason U.S. health care costs are so high is because we don't have universal health care. 
Unlike other first world countries, the health care system in the U.S. is, to a great extent, run through a group of businesses. 
Pharmaceutical companies are businesses. Insurance companies are businesses. Hospital conglomerates are businesses. 
Even doctors' offices are businesses.

Businesses are driven to streamline and to cut costs because their primary goal is to make a profit. 
If they don't do this, they can't stay in business. It could mean that in the process of "streamlining," 
they would be tempted to cut costs by cutting care. 
Under the current system, a share of our health care dollars goes to dividends rather than to pay for care, 
hospitals are considered a "financial asset" rather than a public service entity and a large portion of their 
budgets are dedicated to marketing rather than patient care.

Given all these business expenses, 
it shouldn't be surprising that the business-oriented privately funded health care system we have is more expensive and less effective than a 
government provided universal system. In addition, for the health care system as a whole, universal health care would mean a massive paperwork reduction. 
A universal system would eliminate the need to deal with all the different insurance forms and the negotiations over provider limitations. 
As a result, this would eliminate a large expense for both doctors and hospitals.

The economist Robert Kuttner critiques the system this way: 
"For-profit chains … claim to increase efficiencies by centralizing administration, cutting waste, buying supplies in bulk at discounted rates, 
negotiating discounted fees with medical professionals, shifting to less wasteful forms of care and consolidating duplicative facilities." 
As he points out, "using that logic, the most efficient 'chain' of all is a universal national system."

Evidence to support these points can be found in a recent Yale University study that showed that 
single-payer Medicare For All would result in a 13% savings in national health-care expenditures. 
This would save the country $450 billion annually.

Bottom line: Universal health care would be less expensive overall, 
and an added benefit would be that health care decisions would be put in the hands of doctors rather than insurance companies, 
which have allegiances to shareholders instead of patient care.

4. Point: "I have to take care of my own family. I can't afford to worry about other people."

Counterpoint: It is in all of our best interests to take care of everyone. 
Aside from the fact that it is the compassionate and moral thing to do, viruses do not discriminate. 
When people don't have insurance, they won't go to the doctor unless they're gravely ill. 
Then, they're more likely to spread illness to you and your family members while they delay getting the care they need.

In addition, when people wait for care or don't get the prophylactic care then need, 
they end up in the emergency room worse off with more costly complications and requiring more resources than if they had been treated earlier. 
Taxpayers currently cover this cost. This affects everyone, insured or not. 
Why not prevent the delay upfront and make it easy for the patient to get treatment early and, as an added bonus, cost everyone less money?

In addition, the health of the economy impacts everyone. Healthy workers are essential to healthy businesses and thus a healthy economy. 
According to the Harvard School of Public Health, people who are able to maintain their health are more likely to spend their money on 
goods and services that drive the economy.

Bottom line: The health of others is relevant to the health of our families either through containment of infectious diseases such as 
COVID-19 or through the stability of the economy. Capitalism works best with a healthy workforce.

5. Point: "Entrepreneurship and innovation is what makes the U.S. a world leader."

Counterpoint: Imagine how many people in the U.S. could start their own businesses or 
bring their ideas to market if they didn't have to worry about maintaining health care for their families. 
So many people stay tethered to jobs they hate just so their family has health care. With workers not needing to stay in jobs 
they don't like in order to secure health insurance, universal healthcare would enable people to acquire jobs where they would be happier and more productive. 
Workers who wanted to start their own business could more easily do so, allowing them to enter the most creative and innovative part of our economy – 
small businesses.

In his book, "Everything for Sale," 
economist Robert Kuttner asserts that it's important to understand that businesses outside of the U.S. don't have to provide health care for their employees,
which makes them more competitive. 
From a business point of view, American companies, released from the burden of paying employee insurance, 
would be more competitive internationally. They would also be more profitable as they wouldn't have to do all the paperwork and the 
negotiating involved with being the intermediary between employees and insurance companies.

Bottom line: Unburdening businesses from the responsibility of providing health insurance for their employees would increase competitiveness 
as well as encourage entrepreneurship and innovation, and allow small businesses room to thrive.

6. Point: "The wait times are too long in countries with universal health care."

Counterpoint: The wait times on average are no longer in countries with universal healthcare than they are in the U.S., 
according to the Peterson-Kaiser Health System Tracker. 
In some cases, the wait times are longer in the U.S., 
with insurance companies using valuable time with their requirements to obtain referrals and approvals for sometimes urgently needed treatments. 
On average, residents of Germany, France, UK, Australia, and the Netherlands reported shorter wait times relative to the U.S.

Bottom line: Wait times are longer in the U.S. when compared with many countries with a universal health care system.

7. Point: "My insurance is working just fine, so why change anything?"

Counterpoint: A comprehensive study conducted in 2018 found that 62% of bankruptcies are due to medical bills and, of those, 
75% were insured at the time. Most people who have insurance are insufficiently covered and are one accident, 
cancer diagnosis or heart attack away from going bankrupt and losing everything. 
The U.S. is the only industrialized country in the world whose citizens go bankrupt due to medical bills. 
And, if you survive a serious illness and don't go bankrupt, you may end up buried in bills and paperwork from your insurance company and medical providers. 
All of this takes time and energy that would be better spent healing or caring for our loved ones. 
Besides, we don't need to abolish private health insurance. Some countries like Germany have a two-tiered system that provides basic non-profit care for 
all but also allows citizens to purchase premium plans through private companies.

Bottom line: Private insurance does not protect against medical bankruptcy, but universal health care does. 
The residents of countries with universal health care do not go bankrupt due to medical bills.

8. Point: "I don't worry about losing my insurance because if I lose my job, I can just get another one."

Counterpoint: We can't predict what will happen with the economy and whether another job will be available to us. 
This pandemic has proven that it can all go bad overnight. 
In addition, if you lose your job, there is less and less guarantee that you will find a new job that provides insurance. 
Providing insurance, because it is so expensive, has become an increasingly difficult thing for companies to do. 
Even if you're able to find a company that provides health care when you change jobs, you would be relying on your employer to choose your health plan. 
This means that the employee assumes that the company has his or her best interests in mind when making that choice, 
rather than prioritizing the bottom line for the benefit of the business. Even if they're not trying to maximize their profit, 
many companies have been forced to reduce the quality of the insurance they provide to their workers, 
simply out of the need to be more competitive or maintain solvency.

Bottom line: There are too many factors beyond our control (e.g., pandemic, disability, economic recession) to ensure anyone's employment and, 
thus, health care. Universal health care would guarantee basic care. Nobody would have to go without care due to a job loss, 
there would be greater control over costs and businesses would not have to fold due to the exorbitant and rising cost of providing health insurance 
to their employees.

9. Point: "Pharmaceutical companies need to charge so much because of research and development."

Counterpoint: It's usually not the pharmaceutical companies developing new drugs. 
They develop similar drugs that are variations on existing drugs, altered slightly so that they can claim a new patent. 
Or they buy out smaller companies that developed new drugs, thus minimizing their own R&D costs. 
Most commonly, they manufacture drugs developed under funding from the National Institutes of Health, and thus, 
the tax payers are the greatest funder of drug development via NIH grants provided to university labs.

Oddly, this investment in R&D does not appear to extend any discount to the tax payers themselves. 
In "The Deadly Costs of Insulin," the author writes that insulin was developed in a university lab in 1936. 
In 1996, the cost of a vial of insulin was $21. 
Today, the cost of a vial of insulin could be as much as $500, causing some without insurance to risk their lives by rationing or going without. 
The cost of manufacturing the drug has not gone up during that time. So, what accounts for the huge increase in price? In "The Truth About Drug Companies," 
the author demonstrates that drug companies use the bulk of their profits for advertising, not R&D or manufacturing. 
A universal health care system would not only not need to advertise, but would also be more effective at negotiating fair drug prices. 
Essentially, the government as a very large entity could negotiate price much more effectively as one large system with the government 
as the largest purchaser.

Bottom line: Taxpayers contribute most of the money that goes into drug development. 
Shouldn't they also reap some of the benefits of their contribution to R&D? Americans should not have to decide between their heart medication and 
putting food on the table when their tax dollars have paid for the development of many of these medications.

10. Point: "I don't want my taxes to go up."

Counterpoint: Health care costs and deductibles will go down to zero and more than compensate for any increase in taxes, 
and overall health care needs will be paid for, not just catastrophic health events. According to the New York Times, 
“…when an American family earns around $43,000, half of the average compensation when including cash wages plus employer payroll tax and premium 
contributions, 37% of that ends up going to taxes and health care premiums. In high-tax Finland, the same type of family pays 
23% of their compensation in labor taxes, which includes taxes they pay to support universal health care. In France, it’s 2%. 
In the United Kingdom and Canada, it is less than 0% after government benefits.”

Bottom line: With a universal health care system, health care costs and deductibles will be eliminated and compensate for any increase in taxes.

11. Point: "I don't want to have to pay for health care for people making bad choices or to cover their pre-existing conditions."

Counterpoint: Many of the health problems on the pre-existing conditions list are common, genetically influenced and often unavoidable. 
One estimate indicates that up to 50% – half! – of all (non-elderly) adults have a pre-existing condition. 
Conditions on the list include anxiety, arthritis, asthma, cancer, depression, heart defect, menstrual irregularities, stroke and even pregnancy. 
With universal health care, no one would be denied coverage.

It's easy to assume that your health is under your control, until you get into an accident, are diagnosed with cancer or have a child born prematurely. 
All of a sudden, your own or your child's life may rely on health care that costs thousands or even millions of dollars. 
The health insurance that you once thought of as "good enough" may no longer suffice, bankruptcy may become unavoidable and you (or your child) 
will forever have a pre-existing condition. Some people may seem careless with their health, but who's to judge what an avoidable health problem is, 
vs. one that was beyond their control?

For the sake of argument, let's say that there are some folks in the mix who are engaging in poor health-related behaviors. 
Do we really want to withhold quality care from everyone because some don't take care of their health in the way we think they should? 
Extending that supposition, we would withhold public education just because not everyone takes it seriously.

Bottom line: In 2014, protections for pre-existing conditions were put in place under the Affordable Care Act. 
This protection is under continuous threat as insurance company profits are placed above patient care. 
Universal health care would ensure that everyone was eligible for care regardless of any conditions they may have.

And, if universal health care is so awful, why has every other first-world nation implemented it? 
These countries include: 
Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Belgium, Brunei, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, 
Italy, Japan, Kuwait, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Singapore, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, 
United Arab Emirates and the U.K.

Changing collective minds can seem impossible. 
But there is precedent. 
Once unimaginable large-scale change has happened in our lifetime 
(e.g. legalization of gay marriage, election of the first black president of the U.S. and the #MeToo movement), 
and support for universal health care has never been higher (71% in favor, according to a 2019 Hill-HarrisX survey).

Point: As Chuck Pagano said, "If you don't have your health, you don't have anything."

Counterpoint: If good health is everything, why don't we vote as if our lives depended on it? This pandemic has taught us that it does.

Bottom line: Launching universal health care in the U.S. could be a silver lining in the dark cloud of this pandemic. 
Rather than pay lip service to what really matters, let's actually do something by putting our votes in service of what we really care about: 
the long-term physical and economic health of our families, our communities and our country.

10. Point: "I don't want my taxes to go up."

Counterpoint: Health care costs and deductibles will go down to zero and more than compensate for any increase in taxes, 
and overall health care needs will be paid for, not just catastrophic health events. According to the New York Times, 
“…when an American family earns around $43,000, half of the average compensation when including cash wages plus employer payroll tax and premium 
contributions, 37% of that ends up going to taxes and health care premiums. In high-tax Finland, the same type of family pays 
23% of their compensation in labor taxes, which includes taxes they pay to support universal health care. In France, it’s 2%. 
In the United Kingdom and Canada, it is less than 0% after government benefits.”

Bottom line: With a universal health care system, health care costs and deductibles will be eliminated and compensate for any increase in taxes.

11. Point: "I don't want to have to pay for health care for people making bad choices or to cover their pre-existing conditions."

Counterpoint: Many of the health problems on the pre-existing conditions list are common, genetically influenced and often unavoidable. 
One estimate indicates that up to 50% – half! – of all (non-elderly) adults have a pre-existing condition. 
Conditions on the list include anxiety, arthritis, asthma, cancer, depression, heart defect, menstrual irregularities, stroke and even pregnancy. 
With universal health care, no one would be denied coverage.

It's easy to assume that your health is under your control, until you get into an accident, are diagnosed with cancer or have a child born prematurely. 
All of a sudden, your own or your child's life may rely on health care that costs thousands or even millions of dollars. 
The health insurance that you once thought of as "good enough" may no longer suffice, bankruptcy may become unavoidable and you (or your child) 
will forever have a pre-existing condition. Some people may seem careless with their health, but who's to judge what an avoidable health problem is, 
vs. one that was beyond their control?

For the sake of argument, let's say that there are some folks in the mix who are engaging in poor health-related behaviors. 
Do we really want to withhold quality care from everyone because some don't take care of their health in the way we think they should? 
Extending that supposition, we would withhold public education just because not everyone takes it seriously.

Bottom line: In 2014, protections for pre-existing conditions were put in place under the Affordable Care Act. 
This protection is under continuous threat as insurance company profits are placed above patient care. 
Universal health care would ensure that everyone was eligible for care regardless of any conditions they may have.

And, if universal health care is so awful, why has every other first-world nation implemented it? 
These countries include: 
Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Belgium, Brunei, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, 
Italy, Japan, Kuwait, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Singapore, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, 
United Arab Emirates and the U.K.

Changing collective minds can seem impossible. 
But there is precedent. 
Once unimaginable large-scale change has happened in our lifetime 
(e.g. legalization of gay marriage, election of the first black president of the U.S. and the #MeToo movement), 
and support for universal health care has never been higher (71% in favor, according to a 2019 Hill-HarrisX survey).

Point: As Chuck Pagano said, "If you don't have your health, you don't have anything."

Counterpoint: If good health is everything, why don't we vote as if our lives depended on it? This pandemic has taught us that it does.

Bottom line: Launching universal health care in the U.S. could be a silver lining in the dark cloud of this pandemic. 
Rather than pay lip service to what really matters, let's actually do something by putting our votes in service of what we really care about: 
the long-term physical and economic health of our families, our communities and our country.
